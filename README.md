# üß† Emotion Classification (Single-Label)
This project is about building a **text-based emotion classification** model using deep learning. The model predicts **one of six emotions** from short text inputs such as messages, tweets, or short phrases.

| Emotion   | Example Text                       |
|-----------|------------------------------------|
| üò¢ Sadness | "I felt lonely after coming home." |
| üòÄ Joy     | "I was so happy to see my friend." |
| ‚ù§Ô∏è Love    | "Spending time with family felt warm." |
| üò° Anger   | "I was frustrated with the delay." |
| üò® Fear    | "I was scared walking alone at night." |
| üò≤ Surprise| "I didn‚Äôt expect that news at all." |

# üìä Dataset
- Source: CARER Dataset [Saravia et al., 2018](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D18-1404)
- Original size: **~416,809** samples
- This project uses a balanced subset with **15,000** samples per class.
     - The smallest emotion class in the dataset contains around 15k samples.

     - To ensure balance, each class is capped at 15k samples.

     - Final dataset size: **90,000 samples (6 classes √ó 15k)**

## ‚öôÔ∏è Preprocessing

1. **Drop duplicates**  
2. **Balance dataset** ‚Üí 15k per class  
3. **Tokenization** with OOV handling (`<OOV>`)  
4. **Padding** to max length = 32  
5. **One-hot encoding** for labels  


## üß† Model Architecture

The model is built with **Keras (TensorFlow backend)**:

- Embedding layer  
- Bidirectional LSTM  
- Dense layers with ReLU activation  
- Softmax output for classification  

**Training setup:**
- Optimizer: `Adam`  
- Loss: `CategoricalCrossentropy`  
- Metrics: `Accuracy`  
- Epochs: Configurable (default = 10)  
- Batch size: 32  


## üìà Results

- **Training & Validation Accuracy/Loss**

- **Confusion Matrix**

- **Saved Models**: `.h5` (Keras) and `.pkl` (Tokenizer & preprocessing pipeline)  

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Heavy artifacts (`models/`.etc) are ignored in Git for repository cleanliness.

## üöß Limitations

- Dataset only contains **short text snippets** (1‚Äì2 sentences).  
- Model performance may degrade on **long-form text** (e.g., journals, diaries).  
- Only **single-label classification** ‚Üí cannot capture multiple emotions in a single text.
